       <p>Hi, my name is Isaac Uili. I am currently a student at <a href="https://www.yearup.org" target="_blank">Year Up</a>, enrolled in the Software Development, 
        <a href="https://www.yearup.org/job-training/quality-assurance">QA & Testing Track</a>.</p>
       
       <p>Growing up I've always been surrounded by video games and electronics. I really enjoy video games and eventually I want to make one as well. The creativity of video games has lead me to programming and the possibilities with it has always piqued my interest.</p>
       
       <p>I've been interested in how to apply programming to my daily life, making code to make everything easier. Utilizing that is just a huge benefit, especially in a digital world like ours. </p>
       
        <p>Over the years I've felt my inspiration to make a video game turning into more things of what I want to do. There is a lot with programming I want to do and learning code is just the start. Over my career I want to have experience with all sorts of code to make myself a better programmer overall.</p>

        <p>I see my attendance at Year Up as a huge step in life, by applying myself to coding and being more proactive. Taking every experience with me to the next, I aim for this to be consistent and constantly make myself better than before.</p>
